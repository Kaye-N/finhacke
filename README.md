Our project is a comprehensive financial management platform built on AWS for clubs or student organizations with Firebase as the backend database. 
The goal is to simplify and streamline financial operations, making them accessible and inclusive for all members. 
Our platform ensures that financial tracking, reimbursement requests, and donation management are intuitive, transparent, and easy to navigate for everyone, regardless of their abilities.
